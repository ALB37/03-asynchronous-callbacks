In my reader.js file I am exporting one module, to which two functions are attached. They both do the same thing, one is non-recursive and one which is recursive. The non-recursive function has two parameters, an array (which is expected to have a length of three) and a callback. The recursive function takes the same parameters, however, there is no limit to the length of the array allowed. For both functions, the array is expected to contain strings containing file paths, and will return an array of the text contained in each file. The tests are written to check that both functions will return the expected output for a given valid input, as well as checking that incorrect file paths will return errors. Also the tests are checking that the input is an array, and not an incorrect type (which will throw an error).
